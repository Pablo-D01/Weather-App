# Weather App Project

## Overview

This Weather App project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. It focuses on creating a dynamic and interactive weather application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app fetches weather data from an API and displays it on the web page with a modern and attractive user interface.

## Lessons Learned

- **API Integration**: Learned how to interact with external APIs using `fetch` to retrieve weather data.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Managed asynchronous operations using `async` and `await` to handle API calls and responses.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized JavaScript code into modules (`api.js` and `dom.js`) to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- **Event Handling**: Utilized event listeners to handle user interactions, such as form submissions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```
